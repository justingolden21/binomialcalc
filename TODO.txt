BUG: when generating a link to the learn modal, if the URL parameters are changed then the learn link maintains the old params
	until the link buttn is clicked
	potential solution: try sorting out a system for managing url params
	potential solution: use window.history and url.searchParams to make code cleaner and correct
	potential solution: update learn link on calc() as well
